	# TODO /sdl turns C4996 into an ERROR
	# don't use /analyze; that requires us to write annotations everywhere
	# TODO undecided flags from qo?
	# the RTC flags are only supplied in debug builds because they are only supposed to be used by debug builds (see "This is because run-time error checks are not valid in a release (optimized) build." in https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/rtc-run-time-error-checks)
	# /RTCc is not supplied because it's discouraged as of VS2015; see https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/46mhne/rtcc_rejects_conformant_code_with_visual_c_2015/d06auq5
